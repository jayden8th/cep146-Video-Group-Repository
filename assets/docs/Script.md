Artificial intelligence is changing the way we live and work. It drives automation, personalization, and innovation but also raises real concerns. Whoâ€™s responsible for how AI is used, and who checks the data it learns from? As AI advances,
itâ€™s not just about performance; ethics matter too, fairness, transparency, and accountability. In this presentation, weâ€™ll look at AI bias and data integrity, its impact on the environment, and how it manages security and privacy.

Body 2 - Environmental Impact

1) Carbon footprint

2) Power Consumtion

The second big challenge is the environmental impact of AI.
Training just one large AI model can create the same carbon as five cars do in their entire lives.
By 2030, AI data centers are projected to use as much electricity as all of Canada.
For a brighter future, programmers must make efficiency their core standard, rather than just pursuing maximum capability.

[Script]
AI systems use a lot of personal data, which makes them a target for misuse or hacking.
Developers must design systems with privacy, encryption, 
and strong access control to protect sensitive information.
Transparency is also important â€” people should know where AIâ€™s data comes from and how itâ€™s used.
This helps build trust and reduce bias in AI.
