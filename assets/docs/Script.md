Artificial intelligence is changing the way we live and work. It drives automation, personalization, and innovation but also raises real concerns.
Whoâ€™s responsible for how AI is used, and who checks the data it learns from? As AI advances,
itâ€™s not just about performance; ethics matter too, fairness, transparency, and accountability.
In this presentation, weâ€™ll look at AI bias and data integrity, its impact on the environment, and how it manages security and privacy.

Body 2 - Environmental Impact
The second big challenge is the environmental impact of AI.
Training just one large AI model can create the same carbon as five cars do in their entire lives.
By 2030, AI data centers are projected to use as much electricity as all of Canada.
For a brighter future, programmers must make efficiency their core standard, rather than just pursuing maximum capability.

AI systems use a lot of personal data, which makes them a target for misuse or hacking.
Developers must design systems with privacy, encryption, 
and strong access control to protect sensitive information.
Transparency is also important â€” people should know where AIâ€™s data comes from and how itâ€™s used.
This helps build trust and reduce bias in AI.

[Script]
Artificial intelligence learns from massive amounts of data â€” from books, research papers, and even social media. But that diversity is both its strength and its weakness. Because when AI learns from us, it also learns our biases â€” the subtle assumptions, opinions, and patterns we leave in our data. Thatâ€™s what makes fairness and accuracy such a challenge. Every dataset carries a story, and not all stories are valid. In the end, the integrity of the data defines the integrity of the AI. After all, an AI is only as good â€” and as fair â€” as the information we feed it.

Body 3 - Alignment and safety

[Script]
As AI progresses in development, it not only gets smarter but also gets better at breaking rules sneakily. To prevent safety isues from ai, we need to align the ai with human moral philosophy. Alignment is arguably the most important part of AI developement but is largely ignored by big tech companies due to the lack of monitary gain this field. one day AI will become imposably smarter than all humans and it is imparitive that we are still in control by then.
