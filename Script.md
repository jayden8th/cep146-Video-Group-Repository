2) Power Consumtion

[Script]
The second big challenge is the environmental impact of AI.
Training just one large AI model can create the same carbon as five cars do in their entire lives.
By 2030, AI data centers are projected to use as much electricity as all of Canada.
For a brighter future, programmers must make efficiency their core standard, rather than just pursuing maximum capability.
